## AI generated discussion:{.smaller style="font-size: 0.4em;"}
In this study, we conducted a comprehensive comparison of zero-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning strategies across multiple large language models (LLMs) and diverse datasets. Our findings highlight that while the effectiveness of specific reasoning strategies can vary depending on the model and dataset, overall gains from CoT reasoning remain robust. Notably, GPT-4 demonstrated the most significant improvements when applying advanced reasoning prompts, particularly the “Zhou” prompt discovered through automated prompt engineering (Zhou et al., 2023b).

Effectiveness of Reasoning Strategies

Our results indicate that employing explicit reasoning prompts generally outperforms direct prompting without any specific CoT trigger. The “Zhou” prompt—“Let’s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer.”—consistently yielded the highest performance across models, especially with GPT-4. This aligns with previous research suggesting that guiding models to think step by step enhances their ability to solve complex problems (Wei et al., 2022; Kojima et al., 2022).

Interestingly, while GPT-4 benefited significantly from externalized reasoning prompts, models like Flan-T5-xxl did not exhibit the same level of improvement. For Flan-T5-xxl, direct prompting remained among the optimal methods. This suggests that the efficacy of CoT reasoning strategies may be model-dependent, possibly due to differences in training data, architecture, or inherent reasoning capabilities.

Model Performance Across Datasets

The performance of models varied notably across different datasets. GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo achieved the highest scores overall, particularly excelling in datasets like WorldTree v2 and CommonsenseQA. These datasets, which require general knowledge and logical reasoning, appear to be well-suited for advanced LLMs. The superior performance on WorldTree v2 suggests that better models find this dataset increasingly easier, potentially due to their enhanced ability to process and reason with scientific facts.

Conversely, StrategyQA presented challenges, with models showing lower performance due to the dataset’s ambiguous items. This highlights the impact of question clarity on model performance and suggests that even advanced models struggle with poorly defined problems.

The medical datasets, MedQA and MedMCQA, were the most difficult for all models. Only GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo displayed acceptable performance levels, underscoring the complexity of medical knowledge and the limitations of LLMs without specialized training in this domain. The low performance of models like Flan-T5-xxl on MedQA (Krippendorff’s alpha close to chance) emphasizes the need for domain-specific fine-tuning to improve accuracy in specialized fields.

Impact of Data Contamination
