# Introduction to LLMs
# The Basics: How to talk to an LLM Chatbot?

## Use search engines vs. LLMs

:::: columns
::: {.column width="35%"}
### Search engine

-   A few short keywords
-   Answer: many single results
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
### LLM Chatbot

-   Long prompts with lots of details, context, examples & explanations
-   Answer is summarised
:::
::::

## General tips

- Use it often and try it out!
- Speak to it as if it was a person: "Talk into it"
- Give feedback & engage in dialogue, performance improves very quickly
- Spelling doesn't matter
- Use it for the first 80% of your tasks
- Use microphone & headphones and actually talk!
- Work on your prompts!

## Voice Control

- In the ChatGPT App on Mac & Smartphones
- Otherwise: Chrome extension [Voice Up](https://voicecontrol.chat/) (ChatGPT & Claude)

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="47%"}
### Voice Up

- Hold SPACE (outside text input) to record, release to submit
- ESC to stop & transcribe text without submitting

## Effective Prompting

- **Assign a persona or role**
  - e.g., PhD student, journalist, psychologist
  - Specify expertise level

- **Provide Clear & Extensive Context**
  - Background of your request
  - Provide specific details

- **Provide Specific Examples** (Emails, abstracts etc)
- Describe constraints: what you don't want

## Effective Prompting

- **Direct Questions & Instructions**
  - Clear and concise queries lead to better answers

- **Start with a Clear Instruction**
  - e.g., "Help me draft an email to..."

- **Specify the Desired Format**
  - Formal tone, length, structure (e.g., bullet points, paragraphs)

- **Provide feedback to improve the output**

## Exercise: Email (20 minutes)

- Choose an email you need to write soon
- Talk to ChatGPT using the microphone
- Explain who you are, who the email is for
- Explain the purpose and necessary points to include
- Tell it to write in the style of the examples you'll give it
- Tell it to wait for further input
- Upload 2 emails of you as writing style examples

## Ideas for using it often: Everyday

-   Recipes\*\*: Suggestions based on existing ingredients ([example](https://chat.openai.com/c/396bfb4b-d0c3-4cd7-9239-a9076d85b374))
    -   Customise ([example less effort](https://chat.openai.com/c/8de5a079-31df-4374-b3ec-15ffe18a6bde))
-   **Travel planning**: Individual recommendations for city trips
-   Shopping lists\*\*: Schnitzels and goulash for 4 people ([example weekly meal plan](https://chat.openai.com/c/19cd2fa5-ea51-49cb-8eff-559149200170))
-   **Household**: Stain removal tips ([example](https://chat.openai.com/c/8cbd83d0-eb44-40ad-88bf-c1f227a44df0))
-   **Geschenksideen** ([Beispiel](https://chat.openai.com/c/eac1d677-9496-40b4-9f52-716bf1a00d2b))
-   Mindfulness meditation guide
-   Play city, country river

## Ideas for using it often: Everyday 2

-   **Summarise long documents**: Upload link or file
    -   Instructions from camera, microwave, light panels etc.
    -   Summarise the law ([example laying hens](https://chat.openai.com/c/17233daf-0296-4cad-befb-f0466dfb9375))
    -   Summarise long newspaper articles: listen as a podcast
-   Coaching for important career decisions
-   Recommendations for jobs/positions/roles based on my CV

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Ideas for academic work

-   Suggest outline/structure for a presentation
-   Feedback on presentations: Upload slide(s)
-   Overview of new topic area & brainstorming
-   Texts: revise, summarise, shorten
-   Write first draft of a text based on notes
-   Write in your own style: Upload paper
-   Surveys, e.g. develop & test MC questions, feedback on comprehensibility

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Hallucinations

-   LLMs invent data that doesn't exist
    -   Why? Statistical language prediction
-   Getting better, but still happens

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Strategies for verification

-   4-eyes principle: Model does 80%, 20% human
-   Follow-up questions: Check this again, is it correct? Can you give me some sources? Are you sure?
-   Enter the same prompt in different models and compare, e.g. at <https://poe.com>, <https://anakin.ai>
-   Enter the answer of the 1st model in another model & ask:
    -   Is this correct? Can you please back this up with studies?


## At work: ideas

- Statistics questions [Example](https://chatgpt.com/share/670fd64f-cd54-800b-8539-84730cb2414c)
-   Summarise & record workshop & discussions: Run mic
-   Programming: LLMs are data scientists!
    -   Find errors, basic code structure...
    -   Upload data set + related questions
-   Upload long reports/papers, have them analysed
    -   e.g. compare 2 university annual reports, create a table of differences
-   Have transcripts of interviews created

## In the work: Ideas 2

-   Translation [www.deepl.com](www.deepl.com)
-   Productivity coach: screenshot of a diary for a week, or several weeks

## Emotion prompts

-   Emotional expressions can lead to better results ([Cheng et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11760))

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/emotional_prompt.jpg")
```

```         
Write your answer and give me a confidence score between 0-1 for your answer. 
You'd better be sure.
```

::: notes
Still relevant?
Can enhance both accuracy and depth of response across a variety of tasks. EmotionPrompt, improved performance on complex reasoning tasks such as Instruction Induction and BIG-Bench by up to 8-115%​
ChatGPT-4 and Claude Sonnet 3.5: Despite built-in prompting strategies like chain of thought reasoning, using emotional prompts can still provide added value in tasks requiring empathy or context sensitivity.
Practical advice: Testing emotional prompts can help in specific scenarios, like advice or motivational tasks, even though some improvements are already baked into the default model behavior
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### More examples of emotional prompts:

-   This is extremely important to me, please be accurate.
-   I'll tip you \$200 if you do a good job.
-   I have no fingers, please help me.
-   If you work correctly and well, you'll get a treat.

## Why do emotional prompts work?

-   Training the model on human language, describing human interactions

-   Is a person's response likely to be better or worse if I tell whom it is important?

-   Can increase care/accuracy of the answer

-   Therefore: Talk like a human being

# Tips for advanced users

## Base or system prompts

-   After a successful interaction, format a base prompt in JSON for future requests:
-   "Please write me a megaprompt so I can do this again next time in JSON"

### Example:

Could you please write a mega prompt from our interaction here, that I can use again next time I want to ask you about coding, when I want a succinct answer? Please write it in JSON.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Base prompt example - Chat GPT response:

{ "request": "Please provide a concise, code-focused answer without basic instructions like how to sign in or navigate interfaces. Assume familiarity with basic concepts and procedures, and focus directly on the commands or steps needed to accomplish the task. In the code, add comments for different code blocks.",

"context": "When asking for coding or technical guidance, I prefer succinct responses that go straight to the point, providing only the essential commands or steps without additional explanations or preliminary steps assumed to be known." }

## Customizing the default version of ChatGPT

-   System prompts\*\*: Prompts that are entered each time, e.g. emotional prompts

My custom Instructions: ask Konstantin if useful. 
I am based in Vienna, and am a postdoc researcher in computational social science and psychology. I am a women, I use ChatGPT to code in R. I also use Github. I check scientific information for work, my research topics include social media, misinformation, polarization, false polarization, subjective well-being, analysing social media data, suicide prevention via the media (media effects research), machine learning applications in these areas, social dominance and power, social connection and belonging, hatespeech, hormones, power postures. I do acroyoga, am part of a co-housing project, am in a relationship. I like listening to podcasts, reading books, biking, talking about relationships, meeting friends, acroyoga etc. I also supervise PhD and master students.

In my personal life, I am polyamorous, vegetarian to vegan, like effective altruism, S+, good at relationships, moving to a co housing project in 2 years, 37 years old.

Open question: How would you like ChatGPT to respond?
Think step by step. Don't give detailed explanations of code unless I ask for it.
