# The Basics: How to talk to an LLM Chatbot?

## Use search engines vs. LLMs

::::: columns
::: {.column width="35%"}
### Search engine

-   A few short keywords
-   Answer: many single results <br><br>
-   Real-time information & news via internet
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
### LLM Chatbot

-   Long prompts with lots of details, context, examples & explanations
-   Answer is summarised
-   Answer is statistically probable: prototypical, average, generalized
-   Generalizes across time, no real time-access
:::
:::::

::: notes
LLMs: not ideal for news and up to date knowledge research, better adapted for things that generalize across time (brainstorming, managing projects, creating documents...)
:::

## General tips for working with Chatbots

- There is no one "correct" way to prompt LLMs - we are all figuring this out together. Experiment!
  - _This is the worst AI you will ever use._ [1]
- Use it often and try it out on many different tasks. 
  - _Always invite AI to the table._ [1]
- Use it for the first 80% of your tasks (co-intelligence/ intern).
- _Treat it like a person._ [1] But????!

::: footer

:::

## "Treat it like a person" ?!

- LLMs behave more like people than software/machines.
- Speak to it as if it was a person (although it isn't one)
- Talk into it: give it lots of context
- Use microphone & headphones to actually talk.
- Give it a persona
- Give feedback & engage in dialogue - performance improves very quickly
- Work on your prompts until you get useful output

::: notes
we'll now look at these points in more detail

## Voice conversations

-   In the ChatGPT App on Mac & Smartphones
-   Otherwise: Chrome extension [Voice Up](https://voicecontrol.chat/) (ChatGPT & Claude)

::::: columns
::: {.column width="47%"}
### Voice Up

-   Hold SPACE (outside text input) to record, release to submit
-   ESC to stop & transcribe text without submitting
:::

## 5 minutes exercise

-   Pick one of the ideas, and try it out.

-   Experiment with using voice control. 

## Effective Prompting

-   **Assign a persona or role**
    -   e.g., PhD student, journalist, psychologist
    -   Specify expertise level
-   **Provide clear & extensive Context**
    -   Purpose, background, specific details
-   **Provide specific examples** 
    - e.g. emails, abstracts, posts etc.
-   **Describe constraints**: what you don't want
    - e.g. vegetarian, no museums

## Effective Prompting

-   **Direct questions & instructions**
    -   Clear and concise queries lead to better answers
-   **Start with a clear instruction**
    -   e.g., "Help me draft an email to..."
-   **Specify the desired format**
    -   Formal tone, length, structure (e.g., bullet points, paragraphs)
-   **Provide feedback to improve the output**

## Exercise: Email (10 minutes)

-   Choose an email you need to write soon
-   Talk to ChatGPT using the microphone
-   Explain who you are [persona], who the email is for
-   Explain the purpose and necessary points to include
-   Tell it to write in the style of the examples you'll give it
-   Tell it to wait for further input
-   Upload 2 emails/the email thread of you as writing style examples

# Prompting strategies

## Hallucinations

-   LLMs invent facts/sources that don't exist.
-   Why? Statistical patterns in training data
-   Predicting the next most likely word.
-   Likely = plausible & hard to recognize
-   Trained to give an answer, not to be truthful.
-   Does not have fact knowledge or real-time access.
-   Cannot reflect on its own processes
-   New models much better, but problem is built in

## Strategies for verification

-   4-eyes principle: Model does 80%, 20% human
-   Follow-up questions: Check this again, is it correct? Can you give me some sources? Are you sure?
-   Enter the same prompt in different models and compare, e.g. at <https://poe.com>, <https://anakin.ai>
-   Enter the answer of the 1st model in another model & ask:
    -   Is this correct? Can you please back this up with studies?
-   Sources: use Perplexity

## Chain-of-thought reasoning

- ChatGPT4o vs. ChatGPT

## Base prompts

-   After a successful interaction, format a base prompt in JSON for future requests:
-   "Please write me a megaprompt so I can do this again next time in JSON"

### Example:

Could you please write a mega prompt from our interaction here, that I can use again next time I want to ask you about coding, when I want a succinct answer? Please write it in JSON.

### Base prompt example - Chat GPT response:

{ "request": "Please provide a concise, code-focused answer without basic instructions like how to sign in or navigate interfaces. Assume familiarity with basic concepts and procedures, and focus directly on the commands or steps needed to accomplish the task. In the code, add comments for different code blocks.",

"context": "When asking for coding or technical guidance, I prefer succinct responses that go straight to the point, providing only the essential commands or steps without additional explanations or preliminary steps assumed to be known." }

## Emotion prompts

-   Emotional expressions can lead to better results ([Cheng et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11760))

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/emotional_prompt.jpg")
```

```         
Write your answer and give me a confidence score between 0-1 for your answer. 
You'd better be sure.
```

::: notes
Still relevant? Can enhance both accuracy and depth of response across a variety of tasks. EmotionPrompt, improved performance on complex reasoning tasks such as Instruction Induction and BIG-Bench by up to 8-115%​ ChatGPT-4 and Claude Sonnet 3.5: Despite built-in prompting strategies like chain of thought reasoning, using emotional prompts can still provide added value in tasks requiring empathy or context sensitivity. Practical advice: Testing emotional prompts can help in specific scenarios, like advice or motivational tasks, even though some improvements are already baked into the default model behavior
:::

### More examples of emotional prompts:

-   This is extremely important to me, please be accurate.
-   If you work correctly and well, you'll get a treat.
-   This is important for my career, please be careful.

## Why do emotional prompts work?

-   Training the model on human language, describing human interactions

-   Is a person's response likely to be better or worse if I tell whom it is important?

-   Can increase care/accuracy of the answer

-   Therefore: Talk like a human being

- How? Note taking apps (Notion, Zotero)

::: notes
My custom Instructions: ask Konstantin if useful. I am based in Vienna, and am a postdoc researcher in computational social science and psychology. I am a women, I use ChatGPT to code in R. I also use Github. I check scientific information for work, my research topics include social media, misinformation, polarization, false polarization, subjective well-being, analysing social media data, suicide prevention via the media (media effects research), machine learning applications in these areas, social dominance and power, social connection and belonging, hatespeech, hormones, power postures. I do acroyoga, am part of a co-housing project, am in a relationship. I like listening to podcasts, reading books, biking, talking about relationships, meeting friends, acroyoga etc. I also supervise PhD and master students.

In my personal life, I am polyamorous, vegetarian to vegan, like effective altruism, S+, good at relationships, moving to a co housing project in 2 years, 37 years old.

Open question: How would you like ChatGPT to respond? Think step by step. Don't give detailed explanations of code unless I ask for it.

    :::

## My conversation with an ChatGPT coach {.scrollable}

-   Context: background, my values and where they (don't) fit with academia, what I like about academia, what is difficult for me, what kind of work-life balance I want in the future, how I want to feel in my next job, which aspects I want it to have, my fears about both paths, why I have not managed to make the decision so far... (\~650 words)

-   Explicit instruction & role: "You are an encouraging and empathetic coach, who helps me take this decision that feels like one of the biggest in my life so far. Don't shy away from being directive and giving advice. "

-   What would you do if you had to decide for me?

-   What are opportunities outside academia where my skills are valued? Which types of roles? Which companies?

-   I also have to make a decision today, without any time to explore other things, about whether I accept the invitation for the interview. What would you do there? Accept or not? Please give a recommendation for a decision, yes or no.

-   CV upload plus: The list of job roles and industry you gave me above was also very useful. Could you adapt the list so it is more personalized after reading my CV and my publication list? I have attached them in a document.

-   It's also important that I can work while living in Vienna, I do not want to move. I prefer working on site. Would you make any adjustments to this list with this knowledge?

-   Please, adjust the list again and include only roles outside of academia that fit me. Can you name specific companies in Vienna? If yes, include them in the list. Also, about the data science roles, I am unsure if they fit well. I am a psychologist who knows to code in R and is really good at statistics. I understand Machine Learning, but have not worked with large datasets myself. I have not written any larger ML project code myself, but worked on one with a Data Science student. What do you think about that?

# Significance for the future

-   The role of AI technologies such as ChatGPT will continue to grow
-   Nature of many jobs will change
-   People who can deal with it creatively and critically are in demand
-   There are no "experts" yet, a "right use"
-   We are constantly learning how best to use them.
-   Keep using & experimenting
