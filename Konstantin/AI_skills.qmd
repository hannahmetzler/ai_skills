# Welcome slides

## Who are we?

## Who are you?

## What we'll do today

- Timeplan

# Introduction (Konstantin)

## What is an LLM, actually?

-   Large Language Models: Neural networks = Deep Learning models trained on text
-   Advanced Language models that process huge amounts of text
-   Trained with huge amounts of text data from the Internet (Wikipedia, social media, online media, books, literature, videos, films, YouTube, podcasts...)
-   Turn it into statistical word and sentence predictions
-   Can provide detailed and context-rich answers

## Neural networks

-   Multiple layers of "neurons"
-   Deep learning
-   Linear regressions calculate "weights" for the connections

::::: columns
::: {.column width="47%"}
-   Input layer: Quantitative representation of sentence
-   Output layer: One-hot encoding
:::

::: {.column width="47%"}
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/neuralnet.svg")
```
:::
:::::

::: notes
One hot encoding: output has as many units as words, we predict the one with the maximum value, probabilities of words Input: one-hot times embedding, everything but the mask
:::

## How are words represented numerically?

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Vector embeddings <br> = word embeddings

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wordembeddings.svg")
```
:::

::: {.column width="56%"}
-   LLMs: contextual word embeddings
-   Kontext (vor und nach dem Wort) wird mit repräsentiert
-   [Beispiel](https://www.tiktok.com/@whats_ai/video/7247609946672565510) "Apple": Mac oder Frucht?

```{r, fig.align="center", out.width=250}
knitr::include_graphics("images/apple_context.png")
```
:::
:::::

## How are LLMs trained? - update

All Transformer models (a model architecture for efficient computing):

-   BERT specific, to update: **Masked word prediction**
    -   “New **\[MASK\]** is a city”
-   **Next sentence prediction**
    -   "Today is a beautiful sunny day, and I decided to go for a long walk in the park. Suddenly, the quadratic equation was solved."\
    -   TRUE/FALSE als Feedback
    
## Terms to explain

- context window
- token

## Current top models - To do: update

-   **ChatGPT-4o** (Open AI)
-   **Claude** (Anthropic)
-   **Bard (Gemini)** (Google)

## Multimodal ChatGPT interactions

**(Some also work with Claude)**

- File Uploads (& Claude)
- Browse
- Discovering and using GPTs
- Upload & analyze images
- Create images with DALL-E
- Audio: Talking/Listening
- Data analysis (& Claude)
- Execute code

## Strengths of different models - update

-   [**ChatGPT-4**](https://chat.openai.com/) (Open AI): multimodal interactions, 8.000 tokens (more with API)
-   [**Claude 3.5 Sonnet**](https://claude.ai/) (Anthropic): Writing style, longer context window (200.000 tokens)
-   [**Gemini**](https://gemini.google.com/app) (Google): ??? (Search capability and database, integration with Google services), 100.000 tokens

## Different ChatGPT versions

- ChatGPT4: more resource intensive = expensive
- ChatGPT4o = optimized to be faster and cheaper
- ChatGPT-4o mini: every day tasks
- Only via API or special access plans:
  - ChatGPT-4 Turbo: long context window (128.000 tokens)
  - o1-preview: advanced reasoning
  - ChatGPT-3.5: less resource intense

## Discussion 

- In small groups: 


# The basics: How to talk to an LLM Chatbot?

## Use search engines vs. LLMs

:::: columns
::: {.column width="35%"}
### Search engine

-   A few short keywords
<br><br><br><br><br>
-   Answer: many single results
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
### LLM Chatbot

-   Long prompts with lots of details, context, examples & explanations
-   Answer is summarised
:::
::::

## General tips

- Use it often and try it out!
- Speak to it as if it was a person
- Give feedback & engage in dialogue, performance improves very quickly
- Spelling doesn't matter at all
- Do the first 80% quickly, then check.
- Use microphone & headphones and actually talk!
- Work on your prompts!

## Voice Control

- ChatGPT App on Mac & Smartphones
- Otherwise: Chrome extension [Voice Up](https://voicecontrol.chat/) (ChatGPT & Claude)

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="47%"}
### Voice Up

- Hold SPACE (outside text input) to record, release to submit
- ESC to stop & transcribe text without submitting
:::

::: {.column width="47%"}
### ChatGPT App
![](images/voice_control.png)

- Headphones for an ongoing conversation
- Microphone to record, stop to transcribe
:::
::::::

## Effective Prompting

- Loooooooooooooong
- Provide context, examples

## Hallucinations

-   LLMs invent data that doesn't exist
    -   Why? Statistical language prediction
-   Getting better, but still happens

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Strategies for verification

-   4-eyes principle: Model does 80%, 20% human
-   Follow-up questions: Check this again, is it correct? Can you give me some sources? Are you sure?
-   Enter the same prompt in different models and compare, e.g. at <https://poe.com>, <https://anakin.ai>
-   Enter the answer of the 1st model in another model & ask:
    -   Is this correct? Can you please back this up with studies?

# Outdated tipps?

## Emotional prompts

-   Emotional expressions can lead to better results ([Cheng et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11760))

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/emotional_prompt.jpg")
```

```         
Write your answer and give me a confidence score between 0-1 for your answer. 
You'd better be sure.
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### More examples of emotional prompts:

-   This is extremely important to me, please be accurate.
-   I'll tip you \$200 if you do a good job.
-   I have no fingers, please help me.
-   If you work correctly and well, you'll get a treat.

## Why do emotional prompts work?

-   Training the model on human language, describing human interactions

-   Is a person's response likely to be better or worse if I tell whom it is important?

-   Can increase care/accuracy of the answer

-   Therefore: Talk like a human being

# Tips for advanced users

## Base or system prompts

-   After a successful interaction, format a base prompt in JSON for future requests:
-   "Please write me a megaprompt so I can do this again next time in JSON"

### Example:

Could you please write a mega prompt from our interaction here, that I can use again next time I want to ask you about coding, when I want a succinct answer? Please write it in JSON.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Base prompt example - Chat GPT response:

{ "request": "Please provide a concise, code-focused answer without basic instructions like how to sign in or navigate interfaces. Assume familiarity with basic concepts and procedures, and focus directly on the commands or steps needed to accomplish the task. In the code, add comments for different code blocks.",

"context": "When asking for coding or technical guidance, I prefer succinct responses that go straight to the point, providing only the essential commands or steps without additional explanations or preliminary steps assumed to be known." }

## Customizing the default version of ChatGPT

-   System prompts\*\*: Prompts that are entered each time, e.g. emotional prompts

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="15%"}
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/how_to_system_prompt.png")
```
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/system_prompt.png")
```
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
"This is extremely important for my job, please work accurately and check that everything is correct."

::: notes
My custom Instructions: ask Konstantin if useful. 
I am based in Vienna, and am a postdoc researcher in computational social science and psychology. I am a women, I use ChatGPT to code in R. I also use Github. I check scientific information for work, my research topics include social media, misinformation, polarization, false polarization, subjective well-being, analysing social media data, suicide prevention via the media (media effects research), machine learning applications in these areas, social dominance and power, social connection and belonging, hatespeech, hormones, power postures. I do acroyoga, am part of a co-housing project, am in a relationship. I like listening to podcasts, reading books, biking, talking about relationships, meeting friends, acroyoga etc. I also supervise PhD and master students.

In my personal life, I am polyamorous, vegetarian to vegan, like effective altruism, S+, good at relationships, moving to a co housing project in 2 years, 37 years old.

Open question: How would you like ChatGPT to respond?
Think step by step. Don't give detailed explanations of code unless I ask for it.
