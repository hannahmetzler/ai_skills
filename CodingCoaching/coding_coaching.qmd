## Example coaching session prompts {.scrollable .smaller}

-   Explicit instruction & role: "You are an encouraging and empathetic coach, who helps me take a big decision. Don't shy away from being directive and giving advice. You are very experienced in coaching PhDs leaving academia, and a lot of knowledge about the job market for PhDs with a background in [...] in Vienna."

-   Context: background, my values and where they (don't) fit with academia, what I like about academia, what is difficult for me, work-life balance I want in the future, aspects I want to have in my next job, my worries about each decision, why decision is hard to take so far... (\~650 words)

-   What would you do if you had to decide for me?

-   I have to take the decision today if I accept the invitation for the interview. Please give a recommendation for a decision, yes or no (rather than listing approaches I could take to make the decision myself).

-   What are opportunities outside academia where my skills are valued? Which types of roles? Which companies?

-   CV upload plus: Adapt the list so it is more personalized after reading my CV and my publication list. I have attached them in a document.

-   I want to work while living in Vienna, I do not want to move. I prefer working on site to a remote job, but would consider very attractive remote jobs. Please make adjustments to this list with this knowledge.

-   Please check for specific companies in Vienna where I could find such job roles, and list at least 2 companies per role. 

- I have a doubt about my fit to data science roles. [Explain doubt] How would you evaluate my fit to data science roles? Please give very honest and direct feedback, no need to be friendly and encouraging here. 

::: notes
I am a psychologist who knows to code in R and is really good at statistics. I understand Machine Learning, but have not worked with large datasets myself. I have not written any larger ML project code myself, but worked on one with a Data Science student. I want a job that uses my existing skills well, and not one that continues to challenge me the maximum all the time.

## Productivity coaching

- Context: your role, regular tasks, working hours, most focused time...
- Upload: screenshot of agenda, time tracking data, toggl track task list?
- Example [task prioritization & daily schedule](https://chatgpt.com/share/671655d8-4ec8-800b-8f3f-1654f749f663)
