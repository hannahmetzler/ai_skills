# The Basics: How to talk to an LLM Chatbot?

## Use search engines vs. LLMs

::::: columns
::: {.column width="35%"}
### Search engine

-   A few short keywords
-   Answer: many single results <br><br>
-   Real-time information & news via internet
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
### LLM Chatbot

-   Long prompts with lots of details, context, examples & explanations
-   Answer is summarised
-   Answer is statistically probable: prototypical, average, generalized
-   Generalizes across time, no real time-access
:::
:::::

::: notes
LLMs: not ideal for news and up to date knowledge research, better adapted for things that generalize across time (brainstorming, managing projects, creating documents...)
:::

## General tips for working with Chatbots

- There is no one "correct" way to prompt LLMs - we are all figuring this out together. Experiment!
  - _This is the worst AI you will ever use._ [1]
- Use it often and try it out on many different tasks. 
  - _Always invite AI to the table._ [1]
- Use it for the first 80% of your tasks (co-intelligence/ intern).
- _Treat it like a person._ [1]?!

:::

## "Treat it like a person" ?!

- LLMs behave more like people than software/machines.
- Speak to it as if it was a person (although it isn't one)
- Talk into it: give it lots of context
- Use microphone & headphones to actually talk.
- Give it a persona
- Give feedback & engage in dialogue
  - performance improves very quickly
- Work on your prompts until you get useful output

::: notes
we'll now look at these points in more detail

## Voice conversations

-   ChatGPT App: Mac (& Windows beta) & Smartphones
-   Otherwise: Chrome extension [Voice Up](https://voicecontrol.chat/) (ChatGPT & Claude)

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
### Voice Up

-   Hold SPACE (outside text input) to record, release to submit
-   ESC to stop & transcribe text without submitting

:::

## Provide examples

- An example of the output you want the model to produce.
- Zero-shot vs. one-shot learning


### For example: 
::: columns
::: column

- Emails
- Abstract
- Social media posts/thread and paper
- Presentation slides
:::
::: column
- Paragraph from paper
- Previous recommendation/ application/ cover letters
:::
:::


## Style and Output format

::: columns
::: column
### Style, tone, modality

- formal vs. easy to understand
- caring, professional, bold ([more examples](https://www.learnprompt.org/))
- style of a famous person, researcher, book
- Style of your text example
:::
::: column
### Output format
    
- length (300 words)
- structure (e.g., bullet points, paragraphs)
- Markdown, JSON, csv, coding language
- list of steps
- a table (Markdown format is handy for copy pasting)

:::
:::

## Explicit constraints or whitelist

- What you don't want the model to do
- The task you want your model to stick to

### Example constraints

- "Rely strictly on the provided text, without including external information." (summarizing text)
- "Answer only questions about topic X." (for a converational chatbot)


## Example from during course preparation

- [ChatGPT conversation](https://chatgpt.com/share/671a423d-dba8-800b-bd9a-f27bbe249c02)
- Task: Create exercise to practice prompting
- Context: skill training, my previous slides
- Audience: you
- Example: Writing an email (see [this exercise](#email))
- Output: 3 Quarto slides with one exercise each

## Exercise Option 1: Email (15 minutes) {#email}

-   Choose an email you need to write soon
-   Talk to ChatGPT using the microphone
-   Explain who you are (persona), who the email is for (audience), the purpose (context),  necessary points to include (task)
-   Tell it to write in the style of the examples you'll give it (tone)
-   Tell it to wait for further input
-   Upload 2 emails/the email thread of you as writing style examples (context/examples)

## Exercise Option 2: (15 minutes) {.smaller}

### Extract relevant points from long content

- Choose a recent workshop/lecture, meeting you attended or paper you read
  - Some written record exists (notes, slides, transcript)
- Copy/paste text or upload the document
- Define the persona: academic assistant organizing meeting notes, PhD student preparing for exam, researcher who writes a meta-analysis, ...
- Define the audience: you, the team, other researchers
- Context: Background/focus/purpose of meeting/analysis, exam...
- Task: Tell the model what to focus on. E.g. "Summarize the main points in bullet points with a focus on To Dos/study design/what could be asked in the exam"
  - Example instructions from [Maastricht University prompt library](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/summarise)
- Add examples if any (relevant points, exam questions, notes about another paper)

## Exercise Option 3: (15 minutes)  {.smaller}

### Statistics question

- Select a statistical problem you're currently facing in your research
- Use ChatGPT to explain your statistical question
  - Specify the data set involved, the analysis you're attempting, and any issues you've encountered
- Provide a persona: e.g., "You are a statistics expert with experience in [field of research]"
- Ask for a specific solution, including step-by-step instructions
- Upload a sample of your data or describe it in detail as context



# Advanced prompting strategies

## Managing expectations

- Usually not all of these details in every prompt
- Talk "into it", iterate and add necessary aspects required to improve the answer
- Prompting is not hard to learn
- (Probably) only a useful short-term skill: 
  - LLMs will get good at prompting
  - LLMs will get integrated into software/interfaces

:::

## Prompt libraries

- Library of high quality prompts for your regular tasks
- Use note taking apps or spreadsheets
  - Notion, OneNote, Zotero...
  - Excel, Google Sheets

## Chain-of-thought prompting

- "Let's think step by step."
- Define precise steps you want the model to go through.  
- [Produces longer & better answers, better reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903)

### Exception for the GPT o1 model

- Avoid chain-of-thought prompts: used internally by default
- Keep prompts simple and direct
- Use delimiters: triple quotation marks, section titles
- Only include most relevant information when providing context/documents, otherwise overcomplicated responses

::: footer
[See the o1 instructions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning/advice-on-prompting)
:::

::: notes
Keep prompts simple and direct: The models excel at understanding and responding to brief, clear instructions without the need for extensive guidance.
Avoid chain-of-thought prompts: Since these models perform reasoning internally, prompting them to "think step by step" or "explain your reasoning" is unnecessary.
Use delimiters for clarity: Use delimiters like triple quotation marks, XML tags, or section titles to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input, helping the model interpret different sections appropriately.
Limit additional context in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG): When providing additional context or documents, include only the most relevant information to prevent the model from overcomplicating its response.
:::

## Base prompts

-   After a successful interaction, get & save a base prompt in JSON for future requests:

### Example:

Could you please write a mega prompt from our interaction here, that I can use again next time I want to ask you about coding, when I want a succinct answer? Please write it in JSON.

## Base prompt example - ChatGPT response:

{ "request": "Please provide a concise, code-focused answer without basic instructions like how to sign in or navigate interfaces. Assume familiarity with basic concepts and procedures, and focus directly on the commands or steps needed to accomplish the task. In the code, add comments for different code blocks.",

"context": "When asking for coding or technical guidance, I prefer succinct responses that go straight to the point, providing only the essential commands or steps without additional explanations or preliminary steps assumed to be known." }

## Hallucinations

-   LLMs invent facts/sources that don't exist.
-   Why? 
    - Statistical patterns in training data
    -   Predicting the next most likely word.
-   Trained to give an answer, not to be truthful.
-   Likely = plausible & hard to recognize
-   Does not have fact knowledge or real-time access.
-   Cannot reflect on its own processes

## Improvements for hallucinations

- New models much better
- Online search possibility helps a lot
- But the problem is built in, will continue to occur

## Strategies for verification I

- 4-eyes principle: Model does 80%, 20% human [2]
- Expertise and fact knowledge matters (even more?) [1]
- Check online and give me 5 sources for this claim [2]
- [Chain of Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11495): Check online for 4 facts to make sure that this answer is correct [2]
- Ask for better prompts: Why am I not getting the answer I am looking for? Why do you produce false responses?
  - [Book example in Erklär mir die Welt](https://youtu.be/7i70ssKwiNk?si=x3IvUZoDupXA1OF1&t=906)

:::

## Strategies for verification II

-   Enter the same prompt in different models and compare, e.g. at <https://claude.ai>, <https://poe.com>, <https://anakin.ai>
-   Ask other models: Enter output of model 1 and ask: "Is this correct? Can you back this up with sources? Do these books exist?"
    - [Example ChatGPT to Claude](https://claude.ai/chat/7fc0d00a-a648-4905-a3bd-c336f7a78b7f)
    - [Example Claude to ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/share/671f7e35-a6dc-800b-b02c-0e395158611b)
- Use LLM tools that provide references: Perplexity AI, Elicit, Dimensions Research AI, ScholarGPT

## Exercise: Correcting Hallucinations (10 min) {.smaller}

1. Use a prompt that could lead to hallucinations
2. Apply different verification strategies

- "Please recommend 5 easy to read non-technical books about how to use LLM chatbots for research", books about: psychology/biology
- "Summarize the findings of studies that show that evidence on the connection between mental health and social media use is often misleading. Include a reference list at the end of your summary."
- Quote from an expert on a specific topic: "What does Jonathan Haidt say about why evidence on social media and mental health is not conclusive?" 
- Or: ask about a historical event, details from a biography, most recent statistical data on unemployment in the Maldives etc.  

## Emotion prompts {visibility='hidden'}

-   Emotional expressions can lead to better results ([Cheng et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11760))

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/emotional_prompt.jpg")
```

```         
Write your answer and give me a confidence score between 0-1 for your answer. 
You'd better be sure.
```

::: notes
Still relevant? Can enhance both accuracy and depth of response across a variety of tasks. EmotionPrompt, improved performance on complex reasoning tasks such as Instruction Induction and BIG-Bench by up to 8-115%​ ChatGPT-4 and Claude Sonnet 3.5: Using emotional prompts can still provide added value in tasks requiring empathy or context sensitivity. Practical advice: Testing emotional prompts can help in specific scenarios, like advice or motivational tasks, even though some improvements are already baked into the default model behavior
:::

### More examples of emotional prompts: 

-   This is extremely important to me, please be accurate.
-   If you work correctly and well, you'll get a treat.
-   This is important for my career, please be careful.

## Why do emotional prompts work? {visibility='hidden'}

-   Training the model on human language, describing human interactions
-   Is a person's response likely to be better or worse if I tell whom it is important?
-   Can increase care/accuracy of the answer
-   Therefore: Talk like a human being
