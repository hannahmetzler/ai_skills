# The Basics: How to talk to an LLM Chatbot?

## Use search engines vs. LLMs

::::: columns
::: {.column width="35%"}
### Search engine

-   A few short keywords
-   Answer: many single results <br><br>
-   Real-time information & news via internet
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
### LLM Chatbot

-   Long prompts with lots of details, context, examples & explanations
-   Answer is summarised
-   Answer is statistically probable: prototypical, average, generalized
-   Generalizes across time, no real time-access
:::
:::::

::: notes
LLMs: not ideal for news and up to date knowledge research, better adapted for things that generalize across time (brainstorming, managing projects, creating documents...)
:::

## General tips for working with Chatbots

- There is no one "correct" way to prompt LLMs - we are all figuring this out together. Experiment!
  - _This is the worst AI you will ever use._ [1]
- Use it often and try it out on many different tasks. 
  - _Always invite AI to the table._ [1]
- Use it for the first 80% of your tasks (co-intelligence/ intern).
- _Treat it like a person._ [1] But????!

:::

## "Treat it like a person" ?!

- LLMs behave more like people than software/machines.
- Speak to it as if it was a person (although it isn't one)
- Talk into it: give it lots of context
- Use microphone & headphones to actually talk.
- Give it a persona
- Give feedback & engage in dialogue - performance improves very quickly
- Work on your prompts until you get useful output

::: notes
we'll now look at these points in more detail

# Effective prompting

## Persona for chatbot and user

### Persona

-  As a [...], You are a [...], Act as a [...]
  - Scientist, PhD student, professional journalist, empathetic coach, prompt engineer...
  
### User/Audience: 

- Specify expertise level: Explain it like to a ...
  - 5-year old | PhD in biology | someone with an MSc in software engineering

## Context & Task instructions

- Extensive context: Purpose, background, specific details
- Clear, concise, specific instructions:
  - e.g. meaningful action words [1]
![](images/specific_task_instructions.png)
-   "Help me draft an email to..."

## Effective prompting in a nutshell

**PROTECT** (or PC-TE-TOC "PC Tik Tok")

|  |                                     |
|--------|------------------------------------------|
| P      | Assign a **P**ersona/role                |
| C      | Provide detailed **C**ontext             |

| O      | Specify **O**utput format                |
| R      | Provide constraints (**R**estrictions)  |

## Example from during course preparation

- [ChatGPT conversation](https://chatgpt.com/share/671a423d-dba8-800b-bd9a-f27bbe249c02)
- Task: Create exercise to practice prompting
- Context: skill training, my previous slides
- Audience: you
- Example: Writing an email (see [this slide](#email))
- Output: 3 Quarto slides

## Exercise Option 1: Email (15 minutes) {#email}

-   Choose an email you need to write soon
-   Talk to ChatGPT using the microphone
-   Explain who you are (persona), who the email is for (audience), the purpose (context),  necessary points to include (task)
-   Tell it to write in the style of the examples you'll give it (tone)
-   Tell it to wait for further input
-   Upload 2 emails/the email thread of you as writing style examples (context/examples)

## Exercise Option 2: (15 minutes)  {.smaller}

### Statistics question

- Select a statistical problem you're currently facing in your research
- Use ChatGPT to explain your statistical question
  - Specify the data set involved, the analysis you're attempting, and any issues you've encountered
- Provide a persona: e.g., "You are a statistics expert with experience in [field of research]"
- Ask for a specific solution, including step-by-step instructions
- Upload a sample of your data or describe it in detail as context

# Prompting strategies

## Managing expectations

- Usually not all of these every time
- Talk "into it", iterate, add points
- Create prompt libraries for regular tasks
- Prompting is not hard to learn
- (Probably) only a useful short-term skill: 
  - LLMs will get good at prompting
  - LLMs will get integrated into software/interfaces

## Other useful tips

### Using section headers

- Check how to write Markdown content without executing it

'# Context'
'# Task'
'## Output format'
'# Examples'

### Chain-of-thought reasoning

- Let's think step by step. 
- Define precise steps you want the model to do. 

## Base prompts

-   After a successful interaction, format a base prompt in JSON for future requests:
-   "Please write me a megaprompt so I can do this again next time in JSON"

### Example:

Could you please write a mega prompt from our interaction here, that I can use again next time I want to ask you about coding, when I want a succinct answer? Please write it in JSON.

## Base prompt example - Chat GPT response:

{ "request": "Please provide a concise, code-focused answer without basic instructions like how to sign in or navigate interfaces. Assume familiarity with basic concepts and procedures, and focus directly on the commands or steps needed to accomplish the task. In the code, add comments for different code blocks.",

"context": "When asking for coding or technical guidance, I prefer succinct responses that go straight to the point, providing only the essential commands or steps without additional explanations or preliminary steps assumed to be known." }

## Hallucinations

-   LLMs invent facts/sources that don't exist.
-   Why? Statistical patterns in training data
-   Predicting the next most likely word.
-   Likely = plausible & hard to recognize
-   Trained to give an answer, not to be truthful.
-   Does not have fact knowledge or real-time access.
-   Cannot reflect on its own processes
-   New models much better, but problem is built in

## Strategies for verification I

- 4-eyes principle: Model does 80%, 20% human
- Expertise and fact knowledge matters (even more?)
- Check online and give me 5 sources for this claim
- Chain of Verification: Check online for 4 facts to make sure that this answer is correct
- Ask for prompts: Why am I not getting the answer I am looking for? (Andreas book example)
-   Enter the same prompt in different models and compare, e.g. at <https://poe.com>, <https://anakin.ai>

## My conversation with a ChatGPT coach {.scrollable}

-   Context: background, my values and where they (don't) fit with academia, what I like about academia, what is difficult for me, what kind of work-life balance I want in the future, what I want my next job to be like, which aspects I want it to have, my fears about both paths, why I have not managed to make the decision so far... (\~650 words)

-   Explicit instruction & role: "You are an encouraging and empathetic coach, who helps me take this big decision. Don't shy away from being directive and giving advice. "

-   What would you do if you had to decide for me?

-   What are opportunities outside academia where my skills are valued? Which types of roles? Which companies?

-   I also have to make a decision today, without any time to explore other things, about whether I accept the invitation for the interview. What would you do there? Accept or not? Please give a recommendation for a decision, yes or no.

-   CV upload plus: The list of job roles and industry you gave me above was also very useful. Could you adapt the list so it is more personalized after reading my CV and my publication list? I have attached them in a document.

-   I want to work while living in Vienna, I do not want to move. I prefer working on site to a remote job, but would consider very attractive remote jobs. Would you make any adjustments to this list with this knowledge?

-   Please, adjust the list again and include only roles outside of academia that fit me. Can you name specific companies in Vienna? If yes, include them in the list. 

- I have a doubt about the data science roles, I am unsure if they fit well. I am a psychologist who knows to code in R and is really good at statistics. I understand Machine Learning, but have not worked with large datasets myself. I have not written any larger ML project code myself, but worked on one with a Data Science student. I want a job that uses my existing skills well, and not one that continues to challenge me the maximum all the time. How would you evaluate my fit to data science roles? Please give very honest and direct feedback, no need to be friendly and encouraging here. 

## Productivity coaching

- Context: your role, regular tasks, working hours, most focused time...
- Upload: screenshot of agenda, time tracking data, toggl track task list?

# Appendix

## Emotion prompts

-   Emotional expressions can lead to better results ([Cheng et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11760))

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/emotional_prompt.jpg")
```

```         
Write your answer and give me a confidence score between 0-1 for your answer. 
You'd better be sure.
```

::: notes
Still relevant? Can enhance both accuracy and depth of response across a variety of tasks. EmotionPrompt, improved performance on complex reasoning tasks such as Instruction Induction and BIG-Bench by up to 8-115%â€‹ ChatGPT-4 and Claude Sonnet 3.5: Despite built-in prompting strategies like chain of thought reasoning, using emotional prompts can still provide added value in tasks requiring empathy or context sensitivity. Practical advice: Testing emotional prompts can help in specific scenarios, like advice or motivational tasks, even though some improvements are already baked into the default model behavior
:::

### More examples of emotional prompts:

-   This is extremely important to me, please be accurate.
-   If you work correctly and well, you'll get a treat.
-   This is important for my career, please be careful.

## Why do emotional prompts work?

-   Training the model on human language, describing human interactions
-   Is a person's response likely to be better or worse if I tell whom it is important?
-   Can increase care/accuracy of the answer
-   Therefore: Talk like a human being
