# The Basics: How to talk to an LLM Chatbot?

## Use search engines vs. LLMs

::::: columns
::: {.column width="35%"}
### Search engine

-   A few short keywords
-   Answer: many single results <br><br>
-   Real-time information & news via internet
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
### LLM Chatbot

-   Long prompts with lots of details, context, examples & explanations
-   Answer is summarised
-   Answer is statistically probable: prototypical, average, generalized
-   Generalizes across time, no real time-access
:::
:::::

::: notes
LLMs: not ideal for news and up to date knowledge research, better adapted for things that generalize across time (binstorming, managing projects, creating documents...) Meta-Regeln, Kontext, FRagen/Antwort schrittweise: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfl7q1llkso&t=5s Minute 30 - vielleicht gut als Vereinfachung meines Prompting Teils?

## General tips for working with LLM Chatbots

-  There is no correct way of prompting that applies universally. We are all figuring this out together constantly. 
- We can't predict what will work in a particular use case. \[1\].
-   *This is the worst AI you will ever use.* \[2\]
-   *Always invite AI to the table.* \[2\]
- Use it often and try it out on many different tasks. 
- Practice is all you need to get good at prompting.
-   Use it for the first 80% of your tasks (co-intelligence/co-worker).

# Effective prompting

## Effective prompting in a nutshell

**Treat AI just like an infinitely *patient new* co-worker who *forgets* everything you tell them each new conversation.** <small>[(Ethan Mollick)](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/getting-started-with-ai-good-enough) </small>

1)  **Co-worker**: Learn what it can do well by using it in areas of your expertise.
2)  **New on the job**: Be specific & clear about what you want.
3)  **Forgetful**: Provide detailed background information every time.
4)  **Patient**: Ask for many options & select those you like. Abundance!

Vereinfacht: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfl7q1llkso&t=5s bei Minute 33

Kontext, Frage, Format, Beispiele, Rollen, Zielgruppe, Kanal. Constraints vielleicht entfernen?
:::

## 1) Treat it like a co-worker. 

- LLMs behave more like people than software/machines.
- Work with it, don't give it orders. 
- You are the expert: Start by using it in areas of your expertise.
- You'll learn where hallucinations are a big deal, and where they are not over time.
- Give feedback & engage in dialogue. Performance improves very quickly.
- Work on your prompts until you get useful output

Ethan Mollick: [Getting started with AI: Good enough prompting](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/getting-started-with-ai-good-enough)
:::

## 2) New on the job: Clear instructions

You don’t want _a report on the pros and cons in remote learning_, you want _a report on the pros and cons in remote learning appropriate for a regional university in the Midwestern US and that might convince a business school Dean to fund a new remote learning program._ ([E. Mollick](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/getting-started-with-ai-good-enough))


## 2) Clear & specific instructions

-   Give step-by-step instructions
- Provide examples
-   Give feedback for improvement (dialogue)
-   Include constraints
-   Specify tone & style
-   Specify output format

:::

::: notes
On a slide: include an example on specific & step-by-step instructions here. Use something where the LLM can create a list, then choose the best. Like E. Mollick here: https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/getting-started-with-ai-good-enough, in the figure after "working with AI ia a dialogue, not an order." e.g.: "Write an abstract of this paper" "Write an abstract of this paper for the journal *Nature human behavior*. Focus on the robust methods, the causal design, the novelty and implications of results. Here are instructions on how to write a good abstract: ...
:::

## Give good or bad examples

-   An example of the output you want (or do not want) the model to produce.
-   Zero-shot vs. one-shot learning

### What you could use:

::::: columns
::: column
-   Emails
-   Abstract
-   Social media posts/thread and paper
:::

::: column
-   Presentation slides
-   Paragraph from paper
-   Previous recommendation/ application/ cover letters
:::
:::::

## Style and Output format

::::: columns
::: column
### Style, tone, modality

-   formal vs. easy to understand
-   caring, professional, bold ([more examples](https://www.learnprompt.org/))
-   style of a famous person, researcher, book
-   Style of your text example
:::

::: column
### Output format

-   length (300 words)
-   structure (e.g., bullet points, paragraphs)
-   Markdown, JSON, csv, coding language
-   list of steps
-   a table (Markdown format is handy for copy pasting)
:::
:::::

## Constraints or whitelist

-   What you don't want the model to do.
-   The task you want your model to stick to.

### Example constraints

-   "Rely strictly on the provided text, without including external information." (summarizing text)
-   "Answer only questions about topic X." (for a conversational chatbot)

## 3) Forgetful: Provide detailed context

-   Purpose, background, specific details
-   Copy/paste easily available information (*documents, instruction manuals, previous conversations, emails...*)
-   Use a role/persona (when it's useful, will not always help):
-   As a ..., You are a ..., Act as a ... (*PhD student, biologist, journalist, empathetic coach, prompt engineer...*)
-   Audience expertise level: Explain it like to a ... (*5-year old, someone with a PhD in biology,...*)

## 4) Patience & abundance

-   Ask for several options and select one you like.
-   *15 sentences, 30 ideas, 3 abstracts*
-   Push for:
-   *variation (“give me ideas that are 80% weirder”),*
-   *recombination (“combine ideas 12 and 16”) and*
-   *expansion (“more ideas like number 12”)*

## Example from during course preparation

-   [ChatGPT conversation](https://chatgpt.com/share/671a423d-dba8-800b-bd9a-f27bbe249c02)
-   Task: Create exercise to practice prompting
-   Context: skill training, my previous slides
-   Audience: you
-   Provided example exercise: Writing an email (see [here](#email))
-   Output: 3 Quarto slides with one exercise each

## Managing expectations

-   Usually not all of these details in every prompt
-   Talk "into it", iterate and add necessary aspects required to improve the answer
-   Prompting is not hard to learn - there is no perfection. 
-   (Probably) only a useful short-term skill:
-   LLMs already got very good at prompting themselves (reasoning)
-   LLMs are getting integrated into software/interfaces

## Exercise Options 1 & 2

**Practice instructing your new, infinitely patient & forgetful co-worker.**

1. Translate a paper into a general audience presentation.
    - Context: Paper, audience, focus...
    
2. Do a review of a/your paper.
    - Context/clarity: reviewer guidelines ([general](https://authorservices.wiley.com/Reviewers/journal-reviewers/how-to-perform-a-peer-review/step-by-step-guide-to-reviewing-a-manuscript.html), [psychology](https://online.ucpress.edu/collabra/article/10/1/126218/204033/A-Beginner-s-Guide-to-Open-and-Reproducible))
    - Good reviews you have done/received as examples
    - Inspiration for a prompt to [improve text](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/improve-text-step-step)
    
## Exercise Option 3

3. Write the discussion of a finished paper.
    - Context: Intro, Methods, Results
    - Experiment with different writing instructions (see [here](#writing-style))
    - Experiment with letting the model suggest different outlines as bullet points, improve those, then let the model write full sentences.
    - Write one paragraph after another. Improve. Add each paragraph to the initial prompt with entire paper once you like it. 
    
## Example for writing style instructions {#writing-style .scrollable .smaller style="font-size: 0.45em;"} 

Example of an Writing Style Guide:

### 1. Structure and Formatting
- Use simple, clear language focused on one main idea per sentence
- Employ short paragraphs (2-4 sentences) to enhance readability
- Begin with a concise, attention-grabbing title and subtitle
- Use headings and subheadings to organize content logically
- Incorporate formatting elements (e.g., bold text, italics) sparingly for emphasis
- Use bullet points or numbered lists for key takeaways or steps

### 2. Content Organization
- Start with the most important information (inverted pyramid style)
- Ensure each paragraph focuses on a single main idea
- Organize content into clear sections, each building upon the previous one
- Include occasional single-sentence paragraphs for impact

### 3. Flow and Engagement
- Open with a compelling hook to capture reader interest
- Pose thought-provoking questions to involve the reader
- Maintain a strong flow of ideas throughout the text
- Use transitional phrases to connect ideas and paragraphs
- Create and use strong "concept handles" (catchy phrases that sum up complex ideas)
- Use analogies and metaphors sparingly to explain complex concepts
- Incorporate relevant real or hypothetical scenarios to illustrate points

### 4. Depth and Conciseness
- Provide depth on key points without becoming verbose
- Break down complex ideas into digestible chunks
- Use precise language to convey maximum information in minimal words
- Begin with concrete examples before introducing abstract principles
- Use multiple, diverse examples to illustrate complex points
- Apply introduced ideas to real-world scenarios to demonstrate their relevance

### 5. Persuasion and Balance
- Present a balanced view by acknowledging multiple perspectives
- Address potential counterarguments proactively
- Use appropriate language to connect with your target audience

### 6. Technical and Scientific Writing
- Explain technical concepts in accessible language
- Provide context for why the topic matters to the reader or the broader field

### 7. Tone and Voice
- Employ active voice and direct language
- Maintain a professional yet accessible tone
- Avoid being overly academic or jargon-heavy
- Use an engaging and slightly conversational style to create a sense of dialogue
- Present ideas thoughtfully, showing respect for the reader's intelligence
- Convey complex ideas efficiently without sacrificing depth
- Maintain a forward-looking and slightly enthusiastic tone, especially when discussing potential developments
- Balance optimism about possibilities with acknowledgment of challenges
- Aim to inform and engage without being pedantic or oversimplifying

## Hallucinations

-   LLMs invent facts/sources that don't exist.
-   Why?
-   Statistical patterns in training data
-   Predicting the next most likely word.
-   Trained to give an answer, not to be truthful.
-   Likely = plausible & hard to recognize
-   Does not have fact knowledge or real-time access.
-   Cannot reflect on its own processes

## Improvements for hallucinations

-   Web search possibility helps a lot.
-   But the problem is built in, will continue to occur.

## Strategies for verification I

-   4-eyes principle: Model does 80%, 20% human \[2\]
-   Expertise and fact knowledge matters. Start using LLMs in your area of expertise. \[1\]
-   Check this claim with 5 sources \[2\]
-   [Chain of Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11495): Check online for 4 facts to make sure that this answer is correct \[2\]
-   Ask for better prompts: Why am I not getting the answer I am looking for? Why do you produce false responses?
-   [Book example in Erklär mir die Welt](https://youtu.be/7i70ssKwiNk?si=x3IvUZoDupXA1OF1&t=906)

:::

## Strategies for verification II

-   Write *if you’re unsure or necessary information, say “I don’t have enough information to answer this".* ([One useful thing](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/getting-started-with-ai-good-enough))
-   Enter the same prompt in different models and compare, e.g. at <https://claude.ai>, <https://poe.com>, <https://anakin.ai>
-   Ask other models: Enter output of model 1 and ask: "Is this correct? Can you back this up with sources? Do these books exist?" (Example: [ChatGPT to Claude](https://claude.ai/chat/7fc0d00a-a648-4905-a3bd-c336f7a78b7f), [Claude to ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/share/671f7e35-a6dc-800b-b02c-0e395158611b))
-   Use LLM tools that provide references: Perplexity AI, Elicit, Dimensions Research AI, ScholarGPT

## Exercise: Correcting hallucinations (20 min) {.smaller}

1.  Use a prompt that could lead to hallucinations
2.  Apply different verification strategies

-   "Please recommend 5 easy to read non-technical books about how to use LLM chatbots for research", books about: psychology/biology
-   "Summarize the findings of studies that show that evidence on the connection between mental health and social media use is often misleading. Include a reference list at the end of your summary."
-   Quote from an expert on a specific topic: "What does Jonathan Haidt say about why evidence on social media and mental health is not conclusive?"
-   Or: ask about a historical event, details from a biography, most recent statistical data on unemployment in the Maldives etc.

## No correct science of prompting can exist

## Emotion prompts {visibility="hidden"}

-   Emotional expressions can lead to better results ([Cheng et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11760))

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/emotional_prompt.jpg")
```

```         
Write your answer and give me a confidence score between 0-1 for your answer. 
You'd better be sure.
```

::: notes
Still relevant? Can enhance both accuracy and depth of response across a variety of tasks. EmotionPrompt, improved performance on complex reasoning tasks such as Instruction Induction and BIG-Bench by up to 8-115%​ ChatGPT-4 and Claude Sonnet 3.5: Using emotional prompts can still provide added value in tasks requiring empathy or context sensitivity. Practical advice: Testing emotional prompts can help in specific scenarios, like advice or motivational tasks, even though some improvements are already baked into the default model behavior
:::

### More examples of emotional prompts:

-   This is extremely important to me, please be accurate.
-   If you work correctly and well, you'll get a treat.
-   This is important for my career, please be careful.

## Why do emotional prompts work? {visibility="hidden"}

-   Training the model on human language, describing human interactions
-   Is a person's response likely to be better or worse if I tell whom it is important?
-   Can increase care/accuracy of the answer
-   Therefore: Talk like a human being
