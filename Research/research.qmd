## Exercise Option 1: NotebookLM (15 min)

- Create a new notebook and upload your 20 papers (or 3 other sources)
- Create a Briefing Doc and Table of Content (& other outputs)
- Ask a suggested question, add your own question (maybe also try one that is not directly covered)
  - Check the different references in the answers and their embedding in the source
- Create a podcast with a customized focus (listen with headphones)

## Exercise Option 2: Perplexity (15 min)

* Choose a new research question
* Choose the academic database and pro search
* Ask some follow-up questions
* Check the sources: are they good?
* Rewrite the answer using another model

## Exercise Option 3: Elicit (15 min)

* Choose a (familiar) research question
* Delete an irrelevant paper
* Select relevant study features
* Select a filter (or use a keyword)
* Add a custom-made column
* Find the part of the paper describing the feature
* Upload 3 papers and chat with them

## Other tools to explore

- [Tome]() for presentations
