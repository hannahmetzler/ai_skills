## Let's start our exercise for later: Exercise (10 min) {.smaller style="font-size: 0.6em;"}

**Define a research question in your area of expertise, where you can judge accuracy. Be specific on study population, methodology (RCT), type of study (meta-analyses), outcome variables, etc.** 

For example: _"What are effects of social media use on well-being and mental health, including depression, anxiety and sleep? How does the effect differ between particular subgroups (like teenagers, or girls vs. boys, individuals with and without a mental health condition)? Does it matter how much individuals use social media (dose-dependent effects), and how they use it (for example, passive vs. active use)? Overall, please focus on how robust the evidence is and on what the highest-quality studies say. Prioritize meta-analyses and causal studies (RCTs, natural experiments) whenever they exist. Please include only articles from scientific journals. Please cite all studies in APA format and include a list of references at the end."_

**Open a tab for each of these models & enter the prompt. Let the models compute while we continue with our content.** 

1. Gemini 2.5 Pro (Not Deep Research) (or ChatGPT 4.5)
2. Consensus and/or Dimensions GPT
3. Gemini Deep Research
4. ChatGT 4.5 Deep Research mode if you have a paid account
5. Genspark.ai Deep Research


## What is Deep Research Mode?

- Agentic AI fine-tuned on reasoning models (e.g. o3)
- Suggests & follows an editable multi-step research plan
- Collects sources: Iterative autonomous web search
- Reasons through information in multiple rounds
- Synthesizes information: long & structured research reports
- Your prompt really matters: Expensive compute & limits
- Use all the prompting tips we talked about to write detailed & specific prompts. 

## Deep Research Mode

### Limitations

- factual errors will happen
- not good at communicating uncertainty
- not only scientific sources (except Perplexity)
  - but: requesting scientific sources only worked in ChatGPT for me
- only open access sources

## "Academic" LLMs

- LLMs connected to scientific article databases
- Database: Third party provider, only open access papers
- References: only scientific sources

### Limitations: 

- Reports much shorter
- Often bullet point format
- Often single citations
- Quality of studies varies greatly

## Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

- **R**: LLM can search external sources
- **A**: and add external information as context to the prompt
- **G**enerate an answer based on this augmented prompt. 
- Advantages: 
  - Current information & specific data access
  - Less hallucinations
  - References
  
### How do models identify relevant information/papers?

## Each word or document is a vector of numbers

## Ideas for use cases {.smaller style="font-size: 0.8em;"}

**by Andrew Stapleton**

- Doing literature reviews
- Overview of existing research areas
- Ask for research gaps
- Brainstorm ideas in a research area
- Grant applications
- Ask about common methodologies for a specific question
- Ask about the work of specific researchers
- Translate your research for a general audience
- Fact-check (very) specific claims

## Andy Stapleton prompt ideas {.scrollable .smaller style="font-size: 0.6em;"}

### For inspiration, there is zero guarantee that any of this produces any better result then prompts you would come with! 

- Doing regular literature reviews to keep up to date: Summarize the current research on [...]. Include the main findings, major authors and cite recent key studies in the field. 
- Research gaps: Perform an analysis on [...]. Find research gaps or open questions that need further investigation. Provide references to support these identified gaps.
- Brainstorm some potential research questions about the effects of [...] on [...]. Provide a list of unique questions or hypotheses, each with a brief explanation or rationale drawn from existing studies. 
- Grant applications: Gather facts and references for a grant proposal. Outline the current challenges, why this problem is important solve, and how recent advances suggest our approach will work. Include key statistics...
- Methodologies: I am planning a study on [...]. Which methodologies are commonly used for [...]. Compare approaches and summarize the best practices and recommendations from recent studies with references. 
- Keep up with new trends: Tell me about what new developments occurred in [...] research in the past year. Highlight any breakthrough studies, new treatment trials, or changing theories. Provide a brief summary of each development along with the citation or source (journal or conference) where it was reported.
- Asking about the work of specific researchers: summarize their most influential work and current research focus. Include a few example papers (or other contributions). Check if their research group has any recent publications I should be aware of.
- Prepare a layperson-friendly explanation of my research on [...]. [Provide your paper(s), presentations, any references). The goal is a 2-minute talk for a science festival. Explain what [...] is and why it can improve [...]. Also mention real-world examples (with sources) that highlight the potential of [...].
- Fact-checking: Check the following statement: [Biodiversity has declined by over 50% in the last 40 years.] Is this accurate and reflects current empirical evidence? If so, provide several sources.

## Hannah's preliminary conclusions on Deep Research Mode {.smaller style="font-size: 0.8em;"}

- Excellent to get a first overview much more quickly.
- Hallucinations: Check before you cite in your papers. 
- No actual critical thinking: summarizes majority opinions, will miss critical perspectives/constraints if you don't highlight them.
- Check the number and quality of sources. Often limited. 
- Ask Deep Research mode to include only academic sources 
- Only open access: Do additional research to not miss half of the research. (& publish open access!)
- Excellent starting ground for many research tasks


## Back to the exercise output (15 min)

- How accurate are the reports?
- Do they reflect your expert knowledge on the field?
- Which differences between models/services did you notice?
    - Quality of sources
    - Number of sources searched
    - Length
    - Format
    ...
- You can also use my example reports on the next slide.

## Some impressions from comparing {.smaller style="font-size: 0.6em;"}

::: columns
::: {.column width="47%"}
### Gemini

- Intermediate search time: 5-10 min
- Integration with Google drive
- Large number of websites searched
- Follow up questions create new reports

### ChatGPT

- Slowest: 15-30 minutes
- Most comprehensive research capabilities
- Deep complex topics
- Most expensive

### Consensus/Dimensions

- very similar
- short, but accurate
:::
::: {.column width="47%"}
### Genspark

## Prompt suggestion for the future  {.smaller style="font-size: 0.7em;"}

1. Context (your background and goal): what you already know, what you are researching. 
2. Central research question
3. Specifications: time period, population, study type, output variables...
4. Desired Report Output: Structure, Content Elements (Table, Graphs, Subtitles, Policy Implications, Case Studies...), Target length, Citation style
5. Source preferences: 
    *   **Prioritize:** [e.g., "Peer-reviewed journals," "Government reports," "Reputable news sources," "Industry analysis reports"]`
    *   **Avoid:** [e.g., "Blog posts," "Opinion pieces," "Websites with known biases," "Social media"]
    *   **Bias Considerations:** [e.g., "Acknowledge potential biases in industry-funded research," "Consider perspectives from multiple stakeholders," "Prioritize sources with transparent methodologies"]
