## What is Deep Research Mode?

- Agentic AI fine-tuned on reasoning models (e.g. o3)
- Suggests & follows an editable multi-step research plan
- Autonomously web search, multiple rounds
- Reasoning in multiple rounds
- Synthesizes information: long & structured research reports
- Your prompt really matters: Expensive compute & limits
- Limitations: factual errors possible, communication of uncertainty, not only scientific sources

## What are scientific Custum GPTs?

- Custom GPTs connected to scientific article data bases
  -  Third party provider, only open access papers
- References: only scientific sources
- How does it work?
  - Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
  - Vector embeddings for documents
- Finding similar documents

## Slide on RAG?

- 1 million token window with RAG

## Each word or document is a vector of numbers

## Exercise

Define a research question where you can judge the answer (you have expertise. 
Social Media Question insert here. 

Add it in Gemini Deep Research, ChatGPT Deep Research mode if you have a paid account, maybe Perplexity?, in Consensus and Dimensions Research. 

- How accurate are the reports?
- Do they reflect your knowledge on the field?
- How good are the sources cited?
