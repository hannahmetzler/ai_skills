## What is Deep Research Mode?

- Agentic AI fine-tuned on reasoning models (e.g. o3)
- Suggests & follows an editable multi-step research plan
- Iterative autonomous web search
- Reasoning in multiple rounds
- Synthesizes information: long & structured research reports
- Your prompt really matters: Expensive compute & limits
- Use all the prompting tips we talked about to write detailed & specific prompts. 

## Limitations of Deep Research Mode

- factual errors will happen
- not good at communicating uncertainty
- not only scientific sources
- only open access sources

## "Academic" LLMs

- LLMs connected to scientific article databases
- Database: Third party provider, only open access papers
- References: only scientific sources

### Limitations: 

- Reports much shorter
- Bullet point format
- Often single citations
- Quality of studies varies greatly

## Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

- **R**: LLM can search external sources
- **A**: Add external information as context to the prompt
- Advantages: 
  - Current information & specific data access
  - Less hallucinations
  - References
  
### How is relevant information  identified?

## Each word or document is a vector of numbers

## Our conclusions

- Get a first overview much more quickly.
- No actual critical thinking
- Only open access sources: you will miss research
- Will hallucinate: before including into papers, you will have to check the sources yourself. 
- Excellent starting ground for many research tasks.
- Check the number and quality of sources

## Ideas for use cases (by Andy Stapleton)

- Doing literature review (keeping up to date): Summarize the current research on [...]
- Research gaps: Perform an analysis on [...]. Find research gaps or open questions that need further investigation. Provide references to support these identified gaps.
- Brainstorm ideas on [...]
- Grant applications: Gather facts and references for a grant proposal. Outline the current challenges, why this problem is important solve, and how recent advances suggest our approach will work. Include key statistics...
- Methodologies: Which methodologies are commonly used to research questions X.
- Fact checking: Check the following statement: ... Is this accurate and reflects current empirical evidence?
- Literature summary: which research areas around this topic should I be aware of?
- Keep up with new trends: Tell me about what new developments occurred in misinformation research in the past year. Highlight any breakthrough studies, new intervention trials, or changing theories, Provide a brief summary of each development along with the citation or source (journal or conference) where it was reported.
- Asking about the work of specific researchers: summarize their most influential work and current research focus. Include a few example papers (or other contributions). Check if their research group has any recent publications I should be aware of.
- Preparing for a general audience. My research on ... (include your paper, presentations...), Goal: 20 min. talk at science festival.

## Exercise

Define a research question where you can judge the answer (you have expertise. 
Social Media Question insert here. 

First enter your question in Flash. 4.5. 

Add it in Gemini Deep Research, ChatGPT Deep Research mode if you have a paid account, maybe Perplexity?, in Consensus and Dimensions Research. 

- How accurate are the reports?
- Do they reflect your knowledge on the field?
- How good are the sources cited?
