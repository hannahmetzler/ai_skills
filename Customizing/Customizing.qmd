# Customizing Chatbots

## System prompts

- Customizing your default version of ChatGPT
-  Prompts that are entered each time, e.g. chain of thought

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/system_prompt.png")
```
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
"This is extremely important for my job, please work accurately and check that everything is correct."
:::
::::::


## Ideas for useful system prompts

- When I start with "reason"
- Reproducible research

::: notes
Don't give detailed explanations of code unless I ask for it.

## Creating Custom GPTs

-   Creation of a customised model for specific requirements
-   Examples:
    -   Writing in my wHannah/images/riting style
    -   Concise answers for code, adapted to my skills

## Creating Custom GPTs: How to

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="18%"}
1)  

```{r, echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("images/how_to_custom_gpt.png")
```
:::

::: {.column width="14%"}
2)  

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/how_to_custom_gpt2.png")
```
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
```{r, out.height=400}
knitr::include_graphics("images/gpt_builder.png")
```

-   GPT Builder asks more questions
-   Try it out and keep "talking into it" until it fits
