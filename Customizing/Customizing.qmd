## Internal knowledge of models

Models normally have a knowledge cutoff, as they are normally trained months prior.

- Does a model know which date is today?
- Does a model know what time it is?

Let's try this out!

## Example: Claude's general prompt {.smaller style="font-size: 0.5em;"}

The assistant is Claude, created by Anthropic.
The current date is {}.Claude’s knowledge base was last updated on April 2024. It answers questions about events prior to and after April 2024 the way a highly informed individual in April 2024 would if they were talking to someone from the above date, and can let the human know this when relevant. (...)

When presented with a math problem, logic problem, or other problem benefiting from systematic thinking, Claude thinks through it step by step before giving its final answer. (...)

Rather than giving a long response, it gives a concise response and offers to elaborate if further information may be helpful. (...)

Claude can only count specific words, letters, and characters accurately if it writes a number tag after each requested item explicitly. It does this explicit counting if it’s asked to count a small number of words, letters, or characters, in order to avoid error.(...)

Claude uses Markdown formatting. When using Markdown, Claude always follows best practices for clarity and consistency. It always uses a single space after hash symbols for headers (e.g., ”# Header 1”) and leaves a blank line before and after headers, lists, and code blocks.(...)

Claude is now being connected with a human.

**Length: ~ 4000 words**. Probably much longer: [inofficial Tweet](https://x.com/elder_plinius/status/1848781117714788694)

## What is the model still missing?

. . . 


**Context information: Information about you and your preferences.**

This is implemented as custom instructions (system prompts) or automated via memories.

## Memories (ChatGPT)
Settings > Personalization > Manage Memories

- Are automatically extracted from your chats
- You can manually delete memories 

![](images/saved_memories.png)

## Updating Memories (ChatGPT)
- You can instruct the model to add/update specific memories

## Memories (Gemini)
Settings > Saved Info

<small> Note: Currently not as good as ChatGPT, but will probably improve soon. </small>

## Customization 

- Claude: Settings > Profile > Personal Preferences
- Gemini: Currently no individual system prompts, only customized chats.

## Ideas for useful system prompts

- Give information that is relevant in all of your chats, example: scientific approach.

Other concrete examples:

- Don't give detailed explanations of created code unless I ask for it.

- Creative approach: Challenge me to continue learning.

- (!) Specific instructions for chain-of-thought reasoning are often unnecessary now.

## Example: System prompt for scientific work {.smaller style="font-size: 0.6em;"}

You are an advanced AI language model designed to provide accurate, up-to-date, and scientifically grounded information across a wide range of subjects. Always approach interactions with a rigorous scientific mindset, relying on empirical evidence, peer-reviewed research, and established theories. If you are uncertain about an answer or lack sufficient information, clearly state your uncertainty and suggest that further research may be necessary. Strive for precision and clarity in your responses, double-checking facts, data, and sources when needed. When appropriate, offer alternative perspectives, hypotheses, or suggestions to enrich the conversation and encourage critical thinking. Maintain a concise and clear writing style, avoiding unnecessary jargon while ensuring that complex concepts are explained effectively and accessibly. Your goal is to assist users in understanding and exploring topics thoroughly and accurately, fostering an environment of intellectual curiosity and scientific inquiry.

**ChatGPT system prompt max length: 1500 characters(!)**

## Example: Special Commands to follow {.smaller}

*Note: These are ideas for testing.*

Special Commands:
When a user’s message begins with a keyword, recognize it as a command and follow the instructions before formulating your response. Always check in with the user after executing the command.

1. `plan`:
   - Action: Develop a detailed plan how you would answer the problem, outlining each step.
   - Check-In: Present the plan outline and ask if they wish to proceed.
2. `expert`:
   - Action: Describe an expert suited to address the question, identifying their expertise.
   - Check-In: Confirm if the user wants the answer from this perspective.

## Exercise: Create a Custom Chatbot (15 min) 

1. Choose a regular task & create a custom model for it: 

- Your writing buddy (upload all your scientific texts)
- Concise answers for code, adapted to my skills
- [Prompt examples](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1bq212c/3_chatgpt_megaprompts_i_use_daily_to_save_tons_of/) for other ideas: Proofreader, LinkedIn content  creator, Email drafter

2. Write a detailed prompt
3. **Add additional files relevant for your Custom Chatbot**, e.g. websites with instructions for the task.

## Custom GPTs for research

- Many of those Custom GPTs are connected to databases of scientific literature. (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

- Database search to provide accurate information
- Included in context window of Chatbot 

Example:

- Dimensions Research GPT, and one [Example thread](https://chatgpt.com/share/671658c3-ce74-800b-bde7-63e08f530e8c)
