# In the introduction to different models:

# To Do: 

- Which models exist slide
  - GPT 4.5 (for writing and exploring ideas - is this ChatGPT Deep Research?), 
  - o3 for reasoning and o4 mini. 
  - GPT 4.1 instead of 4: larger window of up to one million tokens of context, gpt4.1 mini, gpt-41 nano. More lightweight. 4.1. is 26 percent cheaper than gpt-4o.
  - GPT-4.5 preview will be deprectated on July 14th? https://www.theverge.com/news/647896/openai-chatgpt-gpt-4-1-mini-nano-launch-availability
  - GPT 5 in a few months
    - Claude 3.7, Gemini 2.5 Pro (free, just less agentic ability)
    -   - slightly less capable but faster and cheaper models (Gemini 2.5 Flash, o4-mini, and Grok-3-mini)
- Update part about o1 to o3
  - o3 mini: quick reasoning (wie Deepseek R1), particularly good for programming
  - better: 04 mini. 
  - trained to problem solve, and use tools agentically (search, write code, generae graphs, explain, etc)
- Include Deep Research: Google Deep Research, Claude Research
  - Think for much longer
  - provide sources
  - limited access with ChatGPT plus (10 questions/ month, 120 as a Pro User
  - still includes unreliable sources, can include hallucinations)
- Change data privacy/data training slide slide
- Claude features: integrates with Google Workspace (calendar, Docs), Research: search in your work context and on the web, verified citations (not yet available in Austria)
- Organize in Projects


# Ethan Mollick Newsletter: Which model to use?

- Has a great image comparing the model's features & skills:

# Intro

- Training: mention reinforcement learning

# Ethics

- Privacy has changed: https://www.oneusefulthing.org/i/155502334/privacy-and-other-factors
- Gemini & Claude do not train on your data, opt-out for ChatGPT
- From the blogpost/newsletter: "very major provider (except DeepSeek) now offers some form of privacy-focused mode: ChatGPT lets you opt out of training, and Claude says it will not train on your data as does Gemini. 
- The exception is if you're handling truly sensitive data like medical records – in those cases, you'll still want to look into enterprise versions of these tools that offer additional security guarantees and meet regulatory requirements."

# Research

- Checkout Deep Research (by Gemini) blogpost (https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/prophecies-of-the-flood): specialized research agent
- Writes research reports, better than the average human, not as good as the best humans
- no good arguments when there is conflicting evidence
- a bit superficial

# New Developments

- Reasoning via reinforcement learning: https://benjamintodd.substack.com/p/teaching-ai-to-reason-this-years

# Prompting (Ethan Molick good enough prompting)

- Try it out for all worktasks and see how good it does
- There is no clear science of prompt engineering. AI is inconcistent and weird. 
- treat AI just like an infinitely patient new coworker who forgets everything you tell them each new conversation
- Treat as human citation: OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4.5 Passes Turing Test With 73% Success Rate [ref](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23674)
## Co-worker

- Work with it, do not just give it orders, learn what it's good or bad at.
- You are the expert: Start by using it in areas of your expertise.
- You'll learn where hallucinations are a big deal, and where they are not over time
- Reduce hallucinations by giving the AI the ability to be wrong, for example, 
writing: if you’re unsure or necessary information, say “I don’t have enough information to answer this"

## New on the job

- Clarity: be very clear on exactly what you want 
  - ("You don’t want a report on the pros and cons in remote learning, you want a 
  report on the pros and cons in remote learning appropriate for a regional university in the 
  Midwestern US and that might convince a business school Dean to fund a new remote learning program.")
- give examples of good or bad responses (few shot prompting)
- give step by step instructions
- give it feedback

## Forgetfulness

- provide context: role, persona (help most of the time but not always, but are not magically turn the AI into that role)
- documents
- pay attention to context window

## Infinite patience

- abundance
- 15 ways to complete a sentence
- email in 3 different tones
- Ask for 30 ideas
- Push for variation ("give me ideas that are 80% weirder"), recombination (idea 12+16) and expansion (more ideas like number 12). 
- Then select one idea you like. 

## Don't make it hard

- Simply use it. 
- Spend 10h to figure out how it's useful for you. Test how it fits into your work and life. 
- Don't aim for perfection.

## General

- AI is unreliable in some tasks. In other tasks, AI is superhuman.

# Images & reasoning

- recognizing locations from photos. Researching other infos about pictures (name of ship and where it will dock next example)
