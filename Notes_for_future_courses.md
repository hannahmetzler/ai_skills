# Ethics

- Privacy has changed: https://www.oneusefulthing.org/i/155502334/privacy-and-other-factors
- Gemini & Claude do not train on your data, opt-out for ChatGPT
- From the blogpost/newsletter: "very major provider (except DeepSeek) now offers some form of privacy-focused mode: ChatGPT lets you opt out of training, and Claude says it will not train on your data as does Gemini. 
- The exception is if you're handling truly sensitive data like medical records â€“ in those cases, you'll still want to look into enterprise versions of these tools that offer additional security guarantees and meet regulatory requirements."

# Research

- Checkout Deep Research (by Gemini) blogpost (https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/prophecies-of-the-flood): specialized research agent
- Writes research reports, better than the average human, not as good as the best humans
- no good arguments when there is conflicting evidence
- a bit superficial
