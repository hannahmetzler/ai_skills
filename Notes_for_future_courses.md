# Feedback last session (April 2025)

## People mentioned they liked: 

- Podcast feature, Notebook lm
- The variety of tools, making them use different models is good, People knew only ChatGPT
- Very informative
- Very overwhelming
- practicality is good
- Examples for prompts help (Exercises in the prompting session might need better prompts)
- More pratical part more interesting
- Deep Research and Notebook LM
- The voice feature
- Do they feel the introduction part was useful? General agreement that some basic intro is.

## Possible improvements - definitely do
- Include a graphic: Differentiation of tools vs. LLMs
- Graphic of training data, live data access, connection to data bases
- Graphic of context window, opening a new chat is a new model without memory, maybe include a depiction of the memory function, custom instructions there?
- Intro: Ãœbersicht Modeltypen in Intro: which model does what in ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude 
  - Reasoning (o3, 4.5, Gemini Pro/Experimental)
  - Flash/Mini: kleiner, effizienter
  - Deep Research Mode vs. model
- In intro: Exercise to test different models - could be extended so there is less theory, some break in between
- Prompting exercises need to be better, maybe more/earlier
  - Maybe include prompt library and base prompt again in prompting session, instead of the prompting advice.
  - shorten duplicate things in the prompting session

# Other suggestions
- 2 days, or even more, with time in between, so people can practice.
- Expert talks to present only 1-2 tools with exercises
- Show where to find buttons live (maybe prompt live?)
- More pictures on the slides
- Maybe shorten intro a bit
- Ethics: Question missing: environmental footprint - not sure that is our task
