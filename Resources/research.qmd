# Scientific tools based on LLMs

## Overview

## Perplexity (5 min)
- [**Perplexity AI**](https://www.perplexity.ai/)
- Like search engine, scientific references
    -   [Example testosterone & behaviour](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/what-are-the-2WzaWWlKRm.4ge6IDNvx3w)
- Exploration
- Tip: Search for best tools using the "social" option, as reddit is searched. (Less clutter/ads)

## Elicit (5 min)
Link:   [**Elicit AI**](https://elicit.com/): Analyse research papers at superhuman speed
    -   Slides [here](https://hannahmetzler.eu/digital_tools_research/04_literature/index.html#7)
    -   [Beispiel](https://elicit.com/notebook/842fc893-e8f5-49a9-8bfb-d2ec6d1831fb)
    
## Exercise Elicit or Perplexity (10 min)

-   Exploring a completely new topic
    
## NotebookLM (10 min)
Link:   [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/): Document-based analyses [Example Tutorial](https://www.gaiforresearch.com/post/introducing-notebooklm-your-ai-powered-research-assistant) [Paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07417-w)


## Other tools to explore

- [Tome]() for presentations
-   Translation [www.deepl.com](www.deepl.com)
- ResearchRabbit for Literature search based on paper networks

## Exercise (15 min)



# Other researcher use cases

## Summarizing content

-   Record workshops, interviews, discussions: note taking and summarization
-   Upload long reports/papers, have them analysed e.g. compare 2 university annual reports, create a table of differences
-   Summarise long documents: Upload link or file
    - Long newspaper articles: listen as a podcast (Notebook LM)
    - Grant writing instructions, specific questions
    - Journal requirements
-   Summarizing a paper based on [Zotero note example](https://chatgpt.com/share/67166160-4cdc-800b-8965-487a32301be8)
    
## Structuring stuff

- Suggest outline/structure for a presentation
- Course Syllabi

## Getting feedback on everything
-   Upload presentation slides


## Area specific research tasks

-   Surveys, e.g. [develop & test MC questions](https://chatgpt.com/share/67166062-c0e4-800b-b018-07562fc3819d), [check comprehensibility](https://chatgpt.com/share/6716608a-2044-800b-9461-c7508b2912b4), [answer options](https://chatgpt.com/share/67166a29-9330-800b-b041-41c1b9554e8c)
-   Statistics questions [Example](https://chatgpt.com/share/670fd64f-cd54-800b-8539-84730cb2414c)
-   Discussion about [social media & mental health](https://chatgpt.com/share/671668f9-c280-800b-83ef-0e591c1200ca)

<!-- ## Brainstorming & Exploration -->

<!-- -   [Journalist interview questions](https://chatgpt.com/share/67166aa4-64e4-800b-b1fc-f5099ce4c53f) -->
<!-- -   [Application: Future research directions](https://chatgpt.com/share/67166bc6-8c38-800b-81c7-abc648c1cbea) (second half of chat) -->
<!--     -   What does research on why people donate show? Please include research from Lucius Caviola, Stefan Schubert, and their collaborators. -->
<!--     -   Have any interventions to increase donations, or get more people to donate, emerged from this research? -->
<!--     -   What are the most important open questions in psychology regarding how to foster prosocial behavior and cooperation? -->
<!--     -   What is a concrete experiment that you would do to investigate prosocial behavior, for example donations? Which design, which experimental groups, or which psychological measures would you use? -->

<!-- ## Exercise Summarizing: (15 minutes) {.smaller visibility='hidden'} -->

<!-- ### Extract relevant points from long content  -->

<!-- - Choose a recent workshop/lecture, meeting you attended or paper you read -->
<!--   - You have some written record (notes, slides, transcript) -->
<!-- - Copy/paste or upload the document -->
<!-- - Define the persona: academic assistant organizing meeting notes, PhD student preparing for exam, researcher who writes a meta-analysis -->
<!-- - Define the audience: you, other researchers -->
<!-- - Context about workshop/lecture/meeting/paper  -->
<!-- - Task: Summarize key points that are relevant for you: "Summarize the main points in bullet points with a focus on To Dos/study design/what could be asked in the exam" -->
<!-- - Add examples if you have any (points that are relevant, exam questions,...) -->

# Try something new

## 3 options
1. Data analysis
1. Creating a website
1. Coaching

## Data analysis
- LLMs are data scientists!!
- link to houseprices file
- take a look into the file
- test different Chatbots and ask for visual data exploration and analysis

## Creating a website
- Turn your CV into a personal website
- [Example](https://claude.site/artifacts/50f01821-fb16-4332-b65e-5499c3b71a0f) to get you started
- Define sections
- Design: give it an example website screenshot

## My conversation with a ChatGPT coach {.scrollable}

-   Explicit instruction & role: "You are an encouraging and empathetic coach, who helps me take a big decision. Don't shy away from being directive and giving advice. You are very experienced in coaching PhDs leaving academia, and a lot of knowledge about the job market for PhDs with a background in [...] in Vienna."

-   Context: background, my values and where they (don't) fit with academia, what I like about academia, what is difficult for me, work-life balance I want in the future, aspects I want to have in my next job, my worries about each decision, why decision is hard to take so far... (\~650 words)

-   What would you do if you had to decide for me?

-   I have to take the decision today if I accept the invitation for the interview. Please give a recommendation for a decision, yes or no (rather than listing approaches I could take to make the decision myself).

-   What are opportunities outside academia where my skills are valued? Which types of roles? Which companies?

-   CV upload plus: Adapt the list so it is more personalized after reading my CV and my publication list. I have attached them in a document.

-   I want to work while living in Vienna, I do not want to move. I prefer working on site to a remote job, but would consider very attractive remote jobs. Please make adjustments to this list with this knowledge.

-   Please check for specific companies in Vienna where I could find such job roles, and list at least 2 companies per role. 

- I have a doubt about my fit to data science roles. [Explain doubt] How would you evaluate my fit to data science roles? Please give very honest and direct feedback, no need to be friendly and encouraging here. 

::: notes
I am a psychologist who knows to code in R and is really good at statistics. I understand Machine Learning, but have not worked with large datasets myself. I have not written any larger ML project code myself, but worked on one with a Data Science student. I want a job that uses my existing skills well, and not one that continues to challenge me the maximum all the time.

## Productivity coaching

- Context: your role, regular tasks, working hours, most focused time...
- Upload: screenshot of agenda, time tracking data, toggl track task list?
- Example [task prioritization & daily schedule](https://chatgpt.com/share/671655d8-4ec8-800b-8f3f-1654f749f663)
