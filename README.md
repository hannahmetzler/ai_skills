# Workshop: Mastering AI Chatbots: Optimizing Research through Effective Use

## Enhance your research with AI through practical skills, customization, and ethical considerations

In this skills training, we will focus on how to use AI chatbots effectively for tasks throughout the research process. 
We will cover how to customize AI Chatbot settings and practice the art of writing effective prompts. 
We will also briefly examine how Large Language Models (the models behind modern chatbots) work, get an overview of different models
and their strengths, and discuss the most important ethical questions around using AI chatbots in research.
