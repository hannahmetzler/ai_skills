# Skills training: Mastering AI Chatbots: Optimizing Research through Effective Use

## Enhance your research with AI through practical skills, customization, and ethical considerations

In this skills training, we will focus on how to use AI chatbots effectively for tasks throughout the research process. 
We will cover how to customize AI Chatbot settings and practice the art of writing effective prompts. 
We will also briefly examine how Large Language Models (the models behind modern chatbots) work, get an overview of different models
and their strengths, and discuss the most important ethical questions around using AI chatbots in research.

## Preparation before the skills training: 

### Chatbot Access: Your Options

For the workshop exercises, we recommend having access to a pro/plus version of one of the best chatbots:

* **Option 1: [ChatGPT](http://chat.openai.com) Plus (Recommended)** To fully participate in the exercises and continue applying what you learn, consider a ChatGPT Plus plan, starting the day of or before the training. It's €24 for a month, with the option to cancel before the renewal date.

   To get ChatGPT Plus:

  1. Sign up at chat.openai.com.  
  2. Upgrade to Plus (under your account symbol in the top right corner).  
  3. For privacy: Go to Settings → Data Controls → Improve model for everyone: off.  
  4. Download the ChatGPT app on your phone. If you're using a MacBook, install it on your laptop as well.  
  5. If you're on Windows or Linux, you can install the Chrome extension [Voice Up](https://voicecontrol.chat/).

* **Option 2: [Claude](http://Claude.ai)** If you primarily use LLMs for writing and value a strong writing style, Claude.ai is a good alternative. It's approximately €22 for a month, with the option to cancel before the renewal date. Claude.ai prioritizes privacy and doesn't use your input for model training (except for safety concerns).

* **Option 3: [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google/advanced/) Pro (Free Trial)** Google offers a free trial of Gemini Pro for one month. If you cancel before the trial ends, there's no cost.

We'll also have some ChatGPT accounts available for shared use, courtesy of the LBG Career Center. While you'll get the most out of the training if you do the exercises alone, working together can also be fun\!

### Files to bring (if you have them)

Having these files available on your laptop will help you maximize learning in the workshop:

* A motivation letter and CV from a previous application  
* Your LinkedIn profile  
* Your own research papers or your Master's/PhD thesis  
* Around 20 PDF research papers (any topic related to your research is fine)

Looking forward to seeing you at the workshop\!
