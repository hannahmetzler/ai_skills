# Workshop: Mastering AI Chatbots: Optimizing Research through Effective Use

## Enhance your research with AI through practical skills, customization, and ethical considerations

In this skills training, we will focus on how to use AI chatbots effectively for tasks throughout the research process. 
We will cover how to customize AI Chatbot settings and practice the art of writing effective prompts. 
We will also briefly examine how Large Language Models (the models behind modern chatbots) work, get an overview of different models
and their strengths, and discuss the most important ethical questions around using AI chatbots in research.

- Workshop developed by: [Dr. Hannah Metzler](www.hannahmetzler.eu) & Konstantin Hebenstreit, MSc.

## Preparation before the workshop: 

### Chatbot Access: Your Options

For the workshop exercises in the LLM workshop, we recommend having access to a pro/plus version of one of the best chat bots. In all cases, you can cancel your subscription within the first month, and will not have to pay for a second month. You could also choose to switch from one model to another after the first month. Please make sure you have access to one of the below options before the workshop. 

* **Option 1: [ChatGPT](http://chat.openai.com) Plus (Recommended)** To fully participate in the exercises and continue applying what you learn, consider a ChatGPT Plus plan, starting the day of or before the training. It's €24 for a month, with the option to cancel before the renewal date.

   To get ChatGPT Plus:

    1. Sign up at chat.openai.com.  
    2. Upgrade to Plus (under your account symbol in the top right corner).  
    3. To turn off model training on your data: Go to Settings → Data Controls → Improve model for everyone: off.  
    4. Download the ChatGPT app on your phone. If you're using a MacBook, install it on your laptop as well.  
    5. If you're on Windows or Linux, you can install the Chrome extension [Voice Up](https://voicecontrol.chat/).

* **Option 2: [Claude](http://Claude.ai)** If you primarily use LLMs for writing and value a strong writing style, Claude.ai is a good alternative. It's approximately €22 for a month, with the option to cancel before the renewal date. Claude.ai prioritizes privacy and doesn't use your input for model training (except for safety concerns).
    1. Sign up under claude.ai
    2. Click Upgrade at the top center
    3. Subscribe to Pro
    4. (Claudet is a voice extension you can only use if you buy API access to Claude. Not for this workshop.)

* **Option 3: [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google/advanced/) Pro (Free Trial)** Google offers a free trial of Gemini Pro for one month. If you cancel before the trial ends, there's no cost.

Looking forward to seeing you at the workshop\!
